Machine Learning models are based on numerical values to make predictions/classification, but how can computers deal with text data? With the huge increase of available text data, applications such as automatic document classification, text generation, and neural machine translation became possible. In this Repo, we will explore how to use Recurrent Neural Networks to classify text (binary and multiclass), generate phrases simulating the character Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory TV Show, and translate Portuguese sentences into English using RNN based Language Models with Keras and Python.

### Notebook 1: Recurrent Neural Networks and Keras

In this Notebook, We will learn the foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Starting with some prerequisites, continuing to understanding how information flows through the network and finally seeing how to implement such models with Keras in the sentiment classification task.
