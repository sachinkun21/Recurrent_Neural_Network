Machine Learning models are based on numerical values to make predictions/classification, but how can computers deal with text data? With the huge increase of available text data, applications such as automatic document classification, text generation, and neural machine translation became possible. In this course, you will learn how to use Recurrent Neural Networks to classify text (binary and multiclass), generate phrases simulating the character Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory TV Show, and translate Portuguese sentences into English. Are you ready to start your journey into Language Models using Keras and Python? Dive in!
